## General Information
- Apply NLP on 'complaints-2021-05-14_08_16.json' data to build a supervised model.
- Then apply existing supervising learning model for new complaints to find the approrite category.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Evaluated this dataset on 3 supervised model, i.e, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree & Random Forest. Got a better optimistic prediction result of 96% in Random forest model.
