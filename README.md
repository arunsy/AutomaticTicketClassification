## General Information
- Apply NLP on 'complaints-2021-05-14_08_16.json' data to build a supervised model.
- Then apply existing supervising learning model for new complaints to find the approrite category.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Evaluated this data on all 3 models i.e. Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest and analyased for various precision, recall, F1 score and ROC curve meterics.
- Got an optimistic prediction result of 91% and 99% respectively in weighted average F1 score and ROC curve for logistic regression. 
- Logistic regression gives better result over other models for this data.
